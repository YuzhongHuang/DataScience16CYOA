# Project Proposal and Learning Goals

##  Dataset
The dataset that we are planning to work on is Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

##  Team
Wilson Tang and Yuzhong Huang

##  Team Learning Goals
Wilson: Practice with extrapolating meaningful results from natural language processing using different and new machine learning algorithms to produce meaningful graphs/plots and interpretations.
Yuzhong: Some level of natural language processing; learn to make meaningful and visually appealing graphs; understand some level of what is inside the black box(how does different machine learning tools works); 

##  Project-Goal Relevancy 
The project is centered around natural processing and sentiment analysis, which can be analyzed using different methods from what we previously used in Titanic Set: Support Vector Machine, K-neighbor, Random Forest Classifier and etc â€¦ And we will use what we learned from different machine learning models to reason why we make certain choice. The results of sentiment analysis also have to be framed in a meaningful way (only a numerical score is not enough) and can be used to generate interesting visual graphs on the different weightings of different scales. It provides an interesting challenge to interpret words instead of numbers and come up with a rating/meaningful interpretation of the sentiment
